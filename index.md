I completed my PhD in Developmental Psychology at Duke in 2021 in the [Bergelson Lab](https://bergelsonlab.com/). I study lexical and phonological variability in infants' linguistic environments and how it interacts with word learning. I'm interested in this question in monolingual populations, where variability arises in the same language, and in bilingual populations, where infants and toddlers need to wrangle double the variability. My primary research methods are corpus analyses and eyetracking paradigms.
